Active development <a href="http://cactusformac.com/blog/posts/cactus-and-glueprint.html">ended December 2014</a>, but I was too lazy to port…until the release of El Capitan broke several pretty important Cactus features, including Sass compilation.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://harpjs.com">HarpJS</a> after a little Googling, and it seemed to fit the bill: super-simple asset pipeline, flexible layout system, and metadata support. And so I set about porting my site from the Python-based Cactus to Harp. This process consisted of three main subtasks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Translating templates to Jade</strong>: Cactus used the Django templating language; Harp supports EJS and Jade. Despite the stronger parallels between Django and EJS templating, I opted to use Jade for its wonderfully terse syntax. I also chose to rewrite all my templates by hand to familiarize myself with Jade.</li>
<li><strong>Rethinking layouts to fit Harp’s layout system</strong>: Harp supports Jade’s <code>block</code>/<code>extends</code> inheritance model, but it also comes with its own <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/development/layout">layout system</a>. I ended up rewriting my templates to use Harp’s native model of <code>yield</code>s and <code>partial</code>s.</li>
<li><strong>Re-organizing metadata</strong>: Unlike Cactus, Harp does not support frontmatter in individual page files. Instead, it uses a centralized <code>_data.json</code> file in each directory. I re-structured all my article and project pages to work with this model of metadata storage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Along the way, I encountered several unexpected roadblocks. The following write-up details how I ended up solving these problems.</p>
<h3>1. Application structure with GitHub User Pages</h3><p>I host this site on GitHub Pages — specifically, my User page. All GitHub Pages are served from the root of their repository, and User pages in particular must be served from the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how my repository is structured (obviously simplified for example&#39;s sake):</p>
<pre><code>sarahlim.github.io/
    +- _harp/
        |- index.jade
    |- index.html
    |- README.md  // Manually placed
    |- CNAME  // Manually placed
</code></pre><p>The contents of the main directory, from top to bottom:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>_harp/</code>, the root of my Harp app (equivalent to <code>/public</code> in non-GitHub Pages sites). It contains <code>index.jade</code>, my &quot;raw&quot; Jade page.</li>
<li><code>index.html</code>, the &quot;flattened&quot; version of <code>_harp/index.jade</code>, produced by <code>harp compile</code>.</li>
<li><code>README.md</code> and <code>CNAME</code>, manually placed in the repo root.</li>
</ol>
<p>Harp’s <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/deployment/github-pages">documentation for deploying to GitHub Pages</a> provides the appropriate command for compiling to the root:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ harp compile _harp ./
</code></pre>
<p>Easy enough, right? Well, not quite. Since <code>harp compile</code> wipes the output directory and rebuilds it anew each time, any CNAME or README.md files I placed in the root directory were deleted every time I compiled a new build.
<a href="http://conoroneill.net/the-nitty-gritty-of-moving-from-wordpress-to-harpjs/">Conor O’Neill</a>’s blog post has a quick fix for the CNAME problem. I simply moved the file into <code>_harp/</code>, and modified <code>_harp/_data.json</code> by adding the following property:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">&quot;CNAME&quot;: { &quot;layout&quot;: false }
</code></pre>
<p>The README.md problem was slightly tricker. I couldn’t just move it into my app directory and exempt it from layouts, because Harp would still auto-compile Markdown to HTML. I ended up adding two files to <code>_harp/</code>: my README, with the filename prefixed with an underscore (Harp ignores these during compilation), and a shell script containing the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">harp compile ./ ../ &amp;&amp; cp _README.md ../README.md
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of running <code>harp compile</code>, I run this script, and it automatically copies and renames my README accordingly.</p>
<h3>2. Auto-refresh</h3><p>Cactus had awesome auto-refresh. I was surprised to find that even though <code>harp server</code> tracks file changes to manage asset re-compilation, Harp lacks native support for live reloading. <a href="https://github.com/sintaxi/harp/issues/80">This</a> GitHub discussion proposes several solutions, ranging from custom bash scripts to auto-launch <a href="http://nitoyon.github.io/livereloadx/">LiveReloadX</a> along with <code>harp server</code>, to forks integrating Harp with the various reload libraries-of-the-moment. After trying several solutions with varied success, I ended up adopting the KISS approach <a href="https://github.com/sintaxi/harp/issues/80#issuecomment-58925661">suggested by Alexander Prinzhorn</a>.</p>
<p>Install <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/">browser-sync</a> if you haven’t already:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm install -g browser-sync
</code></pre>
<p>Then, from the main directory of your Harp application, run the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">browser-sync start --proxy &#39;localhost:9000&#39; --files ‘.jade, .scss’
</code></pre>
<p>(Obviously, you should modify the port and file extensions accordingly. For instance, if you use LESS, replace <code>*.scss</code> with <code>*.less</code>.)</p>
<p>This might be a no-brainer to everyone else, but make sure to run browser-sync in the root directory of your Harp application, where your “raw” assets are located. This isn’t necessarily the root of your entire project — for me it was <code>/_harp</code>, and for you it might be <code>/public</code>. I misunderstood how <code>harp server</code> worked, and made the mistake of trying to run browser-sync in the root of my project folder, where my compiled assets were held.</p>
<h3>3. Nested layouts</h3><p>As mentioned previously, Harp has its own layout system built on <em>inclusion</em>. A top-level template called <code>_layout</code> can include the contents of other files, using the <code>partial</code> and <code>yield</code> variables. This paradigm differs from Jade’s model of inheritance, which is built on <em>extension</em>; sub-layouts extend parent templates by overriding blocks of markup and content.</p>
<p>Harp apps are structured such that the main directory contains a template called <code>_layout.jade</code> (or <code>_layout.ejs</code>). This layout, which typically contains markup common across all pages (such as site-wide headers and footers), “masks” every page served from the same directory. Pages contained in subdirectories also use the parent <code>_layout</code>, unless there is a separate template defined inside the subdirectory, in which case the child <code>_layout</code> overrides the parent.</p>
<p>So, I had (what I assumed to be) a fairly simple nested layout in mind. My site contains a few top-level pages (<code>index.jade</code>, <code>about.jade</code>, etc.), along with two subdirectories called <code>/projects</code> and <code>/articles</code>. Each subdirectory contains its own index — the overview pages for my portfolio and blog, respectively — along with a series of Markdown files, each representing one article or project. I wanted to define a “base” <code>_layout</code> in the root of my Harp app, which would sandwich the <code>yield</code> variable between my site-wide header and footer. Every page on the site would use this layout.</p>
<p>In addition, I wanted to wrap each project and article page — but <em>not</em> the subdirectory index pages — in a “decorator” template, which would display relevant metadata. In a nutshell, I wanted:</p>
<ol>
<li>A base layout, including my site-wide header and footer;</li>
<li>An article layout, which would extend my base layout by adding metadata decorations to the Markdown articles themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Harp’s <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/development/layout">documentation on nested layouts</a> is not terribly clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are taking advantage of Harp’s built-in support for Jade, you may use Jade’s Block and Extends features to create nested layouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that line, I naïvely assumed I could just create the following layouts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jade">//- _harp/_layout.jade

// ...header stuff here

block main
    != yield

// ...footer stuff here
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-jade">//- _harp/articles/_layout.jade

extends ../_layout

block main
    // ...article decorator stuff here
    != yield
</code></pre>
<p>Except, I found out, you can’t actually combine Jade blocks and extensions with Harp’s <code>yield</code>-based includes. So I ended up writing a single <code>_layout</code>, using conditional statements with Harp’s <code>current</code> object (documented <a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/development/current">here</a>), like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jade">//- _harp/_layout.jade

// ...header stuff here

//- Main content
if current.path[0] === &quot;articles&quot; &amp;&amp; current.path[1] != &quot;index&quot;
    //- Article decorator stuff
    != yield
else if current.path[0] === &quot;projects&quot; &amp;&amp; current.path[1] != &quot;index&quot;
    //- Project decorator stuff
    != yield
else 
    != yield

// ...footer stuff here
</code></pre>
<p>There it is. No need to mess with <code>_data.json</code>, no need to build multiple layouts. P spicy.</p>
<p>Overall, Harp has worked swimmingly for my needs. Site updates are simple after completing the initial legwork.
