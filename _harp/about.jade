            In 2013, I co-founded the #[a(href="http://denvermathclub.weebly.com") Denver Math Club], a non-profit organization aimed at fostering elementary and middle school mathematical minds.

            I am a classical violinist studying under the direction of Professor Linda Wang at the University of Denver. Since my debut in 2011 with the Littleton Symphony Orchestra, I have performed across the United States, most recently at Carnegie Hall in June of 2015. My next performance, soloing with the Broomfield Symphony Orchestra, will take place in late May.
